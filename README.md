# NO NAME

This project is a summary of what I have learned in CodersLab bootcamp. 
It has no private of commercial usage. 
I create this more to check myself.
And also I really wanted to learn how to do a website scraper.
I've decide to make something that looks like Steam (because I'm a gamer).


## Description

It is not finished yet. It still have to implement many options:
* editing and deleting user, implement avatars
* editing and deleting games list
* creating game list that you own from available (just like in Steam)
* add commentary section
* adding other users to friend list

and whatever it comes to my mind or what I'll learn.
